##Thank you for visiting my page.

I am a Researcher and Data Scientist who designs and implements quantitative and qualitative studies and performs statistical modeling in R. For several years, I have been working with big, messy data sets from state government and using analyses to make data-driven recommendations to improve efficiency and outcomes for individuals accessing state services.
